# CitiBike

+ CitiBike is a bike-sharing service based in New York City, USA.
+ Citi Bike's has increased in popularity since its launch in 2013. The company’s marketing strategy promotes bike sharing as a sustainable and convenient means of transportation, which has been very successful. Since the Covid–19 pandemic, New York residents have found even more merit in bike sharing, creating higher demand. This has led to distribution problems—such as fewer bikes at popular bike stations or stations full of docked bikes, making it diﬃcult to return a hired bike—and customer complaints.

## Objective

+ Discover actionable insights for the business strategy team to help make informed decisions that will
circumvent availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city.

## Data

* To enrich the data, gather weather data for the year 2022 using NOAA's API service [here](https://www.noaa.gov/).  

## Tool
+ Python libraries:
    + Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to make charts;
    + pandas and Kepler.gl to create maps, and
    + Streamlit to design your final dashboard.

## Data Analysis

+ Conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data, to understand user's behavior to help the business strategy department assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city and identify expansion opportunities.

## Data Visualization
