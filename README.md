# CitiBike

+ CitiBike is a bike-sharing service based in New York City, USA.
+ CitiBike's has increased in popularity since its launch in 2013. The company’s marketing strategy promotes bike sharing as a sustainable and convenient means of transportation, which has been very successful. Since the Covid–19 pandemic, New York residents have found even more merit in bike sharing, creating higher demand. This has led to distribution problems—such as fewer bikes at popular bike stations or stations full of docked bikes, making it diﬃcult to return a hired bike, and customer complaints.

## Objective
+ Discover actionable insights for the business strategy team to help make informed decisions that will circumvent availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city.

## Data
* The open-source CitiBike dataset can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html).
* To enrich the data, gather weather data for the year 2022 using NOAA's API service [here](https://www.noaa.gov/).  

## Tool
+ Python libraries:
    + Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to make charts,
    + pandas and KeplerGl to create maps, and
    + Streamlit to design the final dashboard.

## Data Analysis
+ Conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data, to understand user's behavior to help the business strategy department assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city and identify expansion opportunities.
+ All the necessary files for the analysis can be found on GitHub under the CitiBike repository.

## Data Visualization
+ Create a dashboard in Python to showcase the findings of the analysis.
+ The requirements and Python code to build the dashboard for the NY CitiBike project are also in the CitiBike repository.
+ A link to the dashboard is [here](https://citibike-pwhqpkxqefsckt9bxcn9tv.streamlit.app/).

#### Note:
+ The final steps of the analysis display a random sample comprising 8% of the dataset.
+ This is done to facilitate easier data manipulation and accommodate resource limitations.
